      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my personal page, created for the UofW Coding Bootcamp Pre-coursework. </p> 
      <p>I began working in web design in 1993 with a company called Epoch Networks. During that time, I designed the Mirage Hotel's first website, Rodney Dangerfields first website, Gargoyles and Hobie Cat Sunglasses site, among other less well known companies and brands.</p>
      <p>After leaving Epoch Netowrks in 1995, I went to work for Microsoft where I worked on the dev team which created some of Microsoft's first HTML-based technologies, which would later become products like SharePoint and Commerce Server. We also dabbled in some early concepts of cloud-based services</p>
      <p> After leaving Microsoft in 1999, I've spent the last 20 years working on various dev teams as a project manager, technical editor, site producer, and even taught CE classes in HTML and CSS at Highline Community College, but eventually found myself where I am today as a support engineer managing the ServiceNow ITSM Platform for IT Service Mangement.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm a 5th generation Washingtonian! My family came here from England and Scotland in the late 1800s to work in the logging industry. I've lived in Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Whidbey Island, Seattle, and Renton-Newcastle.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love drawing, sewing, reading, and because of that, I have no trouble staying at home (which we've all done a lot of lately!)</p>  
      <p>My very favorite hobby is traveling and I do it whenever I can. I've visited over 100 countries! My most recent adventure was a month abroad visiting, Zanzibar, Tanzania, United Arab Emerites, and Oman. There really isn't anywhere on this planet I won't visit! And aim to see it all!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream "job" would be, retired! But, since that's not the answer anyone is after in this space, I'd have to say I'd like to be a consulting ServiceNow Integration Specialist</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In the Renton-Newcastle area!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Having been a web designer for many years, my goals are to update my skills I never had the chance to update, so I can move on to expand my skillsets as a platform manager and developer.</p>

      <p>After 30 years in the software and IT fields, I've found I'm a knower of all, master of none. Time to master something after all these years!</p>
