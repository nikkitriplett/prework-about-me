      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my personal page, created for the UofW Coding Bootcamp Pre-coursework. </p> 
      <p>I began working in web design in 1993 with a company called Epoch Networks. During that time, I designed the Mirage Hotel's first website, Rodney Dangerfields first website, Gargoyles and Hobie Cat Sunglasses site, among other lesser companies and brands.</p>
      <p>After leaving Epoch Netowrks in 1995, I went to work for Microsoft where I worked on the dev team which created some of Microsofts first HTML-based technologies, which would later become products like SharePoint and Commerce Server. We also dabbled in some early concepts of cloud-based services</p>
      <p> After leaving Microsoft in 1999, I'd spend the 20 years working on various dev teams as a project manager, technical editor, site producer, and eventually found myself where I am today as a support engineer managing the ServiceNow ITSM Platform for IT Service Mangement.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm a 5th generation Washingtonian! My family came here from England and Scotland in the late 1800s to work in the logging industry. I've lived in Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland, Whidbey Island, Seattle and Renton.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like any hobby that's painstakingly detailed, predominately drawing and bead embroidery. I also love live music and spend a fair amount of time out listening to new local bands (there's some serious talent in this region!) And my most favorite hobby is traveling. To date, I've visited over 100 countries, most recently Tanzania, Mozambique, United Arab Emerites, and Oman. There really isn't anywhere on this planet I won't visit!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream "job" would retired! But, since that's not the answer anyone is after in this space, I'd have to say I'd like to be a consulting Integration Specialist for ServiceNow</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In the Renton/Newscastle area!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Having been a web designer for many years, my goals are to update my skills I never had the chance to update, so I can move on to expand my skillsets as a platform manager and developer.</p>
